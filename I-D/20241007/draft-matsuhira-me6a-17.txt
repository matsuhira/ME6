          Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 mapped IPv6 address (ME6A)
                        draft-matsuhira-me6a-17

Abstract

   This document specifies Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(ME6A) spefification.  ME6A is an Ethernet-mapped IPv6 address
   with a plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane id value enables
   duplicated MAC address unique in IPv6 address space.  This address
   may use Ethernet over IPv6 encapsulation.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(ME6A) spefification.  ME6A is an Ethernet-mapped IPv6 address
   with a plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane ID value enables
   duplicated MAC address unique in IPv6 address space.

   This address may use Ethernet over IPv6 encapsulation such as
   Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 mapping encapsulation - fixed prefix (ME6E-
   FP) [I-D.draft-matsuhira-me6e-fp] and Multiple Ethernet - IPv6
   mapping encapsulation - prefix resolution (ME6E-
   PR)[I-D.draft-matsuhira-me6e-pr].

2.  ME6A architecture


   Figure 1 shows ME6A architecture.

    |    128 - m -n bits    |        m bits        |       n bits     |
    +-----------------------+----------------------+------------------+
    |      ME6A prefix      |  Ethernet plane ID   | Ethernet address |
    +-----------------------+----------------------+------------------+

                                  Figure 1


   ME6A consists of three parts as follows.

   ME6A prefix
      ME6A prefix.  This value is fixed value with M46E-FP, and non
      fixed value with M46E-PR.

   Ethernet plane ID
      Ethernet network plane ID is the network identification of
      Ethernet network plane.

   Ethernet address
      Ethernet MAC address.  EUI-48 address or EUI-64 address.



3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.
